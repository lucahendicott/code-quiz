# JavaScript Code Quiz

This web application generates a timed javascript quiz. When the user clicks the button to start the quiz, the app displays the first question and a timer starts counting down from 100 seconds. Upon answering each question, the user will be alerted if the answer was correct or incorrect, then the next question will be displayed. For any incorrect answer, time left is deducted by 10 seconds. If the quiz is not completed within the elotted time given, the quiz will end. Upon completetion, the app will display the user's score and ask for their initials. When they press submit, their initials will show up with their score. They then have the option to clear out the scores and/or retake the quiz!
